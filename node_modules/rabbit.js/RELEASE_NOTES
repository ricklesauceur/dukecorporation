rabbit.js release notes
=======================

v0.2.1
------

Supports:
 - Node.JS v0.6, v0.8, v0.10*

*node-amqp presently does not claim to support Node.JS 0.10, but
 appears to run OK.

Main changes since v0.2:

 * Use util.inherits consistently instead of working coincidentally
   (https://github.com/squaremo/rabbit.js/pull/35,
   https://github.com/squaremo/rabbit.js/issues/37 and
   https://github.com/squaremo/rabbit.js/issues/38)

 * Channel-level (i.e., most) errors are propagated through to
   rabbit.js sockets (https://github.com/squaremo/rabbit.js/issues/28)

 * Depends on a recent node-amqp
   (https://github.com/squaremo/rabbit.js/pull/27 and
   https://github.com/squaremo/rabbit.js/issues/25)

 * Finally has some smoke tests
